# pos_tagger
Part of speech tagger using NLTK, Spacy, and Stanford Core NLP

This part of speech tagger uses NLTK, Spacy, and the Stanford Core NLP
taggers to assign part of speech tags to sentences. A sentence is entered in
the command line and is tagged by each tagger. The results are then combined
into a single tagged sentence.
